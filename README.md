# The Story So Far

Stephan "Zeke" Ritter is the son of German immigrants.  He prefers to be called Zeke, which is a shortened version of his middle name, Ezekiel.  Zeke served on the Union side in the Civil War for a short time and was transferred to help in the Indian Wars.  During his short tenure in the Great Plains, his company was attacked and massacred by the Sioux.  He was the only survivor.  After escaping, he was forced to scavenge and hunt for food in the wilderness for six months.  Traumatized by the experience, he went completely mad.  He was found by a group of Pawnee who were friendly with the whites.  They took him to their Shaman so that the spirits haunting Zeke could be exorcised.  
	
The Shaman was unable to cure Zeke.  During a long ceremony, Zeke had a fit of insane rage and killed the Shaman.  He took the Shaman's turtle shell rattle, a special magical artifact that comes into play later in the adventure.  This all happened ten years ago.  Zeke has always been interested in hunting and taxidermy, but his malaise has caused his little hobby to turn macabre.  Zeke has turned to shooting and stuffing various species of Homo sapiens.  One of the members of the posse fits the missing piece in his collection 😉

## Starting

The adventure begins when the posse congregates with the same job flyer at outskirts of town.  The posse's goal is to survey the area of recent wildlife attacks and report back any findings for a reward.  They do not know, however, a strangely possessed Mountain Lion is the culprit behind the attacks.

They will trek off to the wilderness and encounter a point of contact from the flyer, ***Lawrence Rodgers***.  He has set up a small base camp just outside the territory which is about a 30 minute horse ride outside of *Virginia City, Nevada*.  He has dinner prepared and offers the posse some Brunswick Stew (our session starts at 11AM CST so by this point hopefully we take a small break for lunch and eat while talking in character to each other!).

### The Great Hunters

At night, the posse is stalked by a mated pair of mountain lions.  The puma are seemingly driven by starvation and have been taking livestock from nearby farms and ranches (if we have a Blessed he can roll to ascertain it's because of dark spirits instead).  While the flyer offered a high reward (primary motivation for most), it's quickly learned why.  A posse member spots one of the puma just before it attacks one of the other sleeping members of the posse, unless he/she fails a notice check (can also include Lawrence).  As the posse is fighting the first puma, have them notice the second puma hanging back.  It is *much* larger than the first, and slips into the shadow before the posse can do anything about it.

When the posse gets the mountain lion killed, they realize it's a *really* big brute!  Shortly thereafter, a fella by the name of ***Lance O' Boyle*** approaches the camp on horseback.  Over the panting of his very tired horse, he explains that he was camped not very far away and that he heard gunshots.  Seeing the dead puma, he congratulates the posse and tells them about the area being haunted by these puma.

On the way back to town, the posse passes a camp of three Indians from the Pawnee tribe.  If the posse leaves them alone, the Indians leave the posse alone.  The leader of the group is a powerful Shaman named ***Spring Star***.  He camps with his two sons, ***Little Coyote*** and ***River Child***, who are strong braves in their own right.  They are searching for a sacred artifact taken from them many years ago.  

(if noticed)
***Spring Star*** is easily noticed in the camp, but his two sons draw bows and arrows on the posse.  With a wave of his hand, ***Spring Star*** tells his sons to stand down.  The Shaman tells the posse that "nature is unbalanced" in the area with a combination of feigned broken English and hand gestures.   

### The Hunter's Lodge

O'Boyle leads the posse into town and directly to Zeke's Hunter's Lodge, where he helps the posse turn in their puma carcass the flyer's author.  Because there are actually two cats, the posse only gets half the reward.  The posse is introduced to Stephfan 'Zeke' Ritter, sole proprietor of the Lodge and also the local taxidermist and dentist.  He will happily point to an elk and/or red fox with a comically immaculate set of veneers on the wall if asked.  

The building is divided up into two parts.  The front serves as a small bar and the back is the taxidermy and dental office.  Both places are filled with numerous mounted trophy animals.  Zeke offers to stuff the puma for free as long as he can display at the lodge for a few months.  He also offers a free drink in celebration!

Later, the posse have some drinks and food and meet Lily, a server and saloon gal at the bar.  As the posse is toasting with a shot of whiskey, one of the patron's pinches Lily's caboose.  She has a fit, slaps the guy, and quits right on the spot.  Then she storms out.  Zeke shakes his head and says the he suspected she would quit any day.  His only regret was that she was such a perfect *physical specimen*.

After the posse get their free drink, Zeke and Lance propose that they and the posse should go back out and find the Mountain Lion's mate.  They do their best to get at least some of the posse to go with them.  When the party gets ready to leave for the hunt, they notice the Pawnee Shaman and his sons hanging out by the stables watching them.  If the Pawnee are approached, they feign ignorance of the English language.  The Pawnee are more concerned with Zeke.  (if ignored from before)

Zeke elects to hang back and hire some "experienced" hunters to aid the posse.  These hunters instead try to kidnap the posse member who fits his missing collection.  These lowlifes aren't very smart and try to kill the posse member in an obvious way. The probably attack even if that hero isn't alone. With a Notice roll, the posse sees that Zeke is hanging around when the attack comes.

The posse may remember seeing the same kind of silver dollars at Zeke's Hunter's Lodge with a successful Common Knowledge check.  If, after this, the posse is insistent about getting the second mountain lion, have them corner it somewhere in the hills and bag the thing. (similar stats to first)

### The Taxidermy Dental Office

The posse is going to most likely be getting sus at this point.  They may want to go poking around the taxidermy shop.  Smort, because that's where the danger lies.  Zeke keeps the doors locked and the posse is going to have to pick the lock or break the door down.  If they make a lot of noise, the town marshal comes around to investigate ten minutes after that time.

If the posse break in at night, they find the numerous stuffed animals disturbing.  Have each make a +2 Guts roll.  With a successful Common Knowledge check, they realize that several wooden frames Zeke is building to go inside an animal look remarkably like the shape of a human being.  With a successful Notice roll, the posse find two fancy name plates wrapped up in paper and hidden away under the counter.  They read, “North American Caucasian Female” and such. One is a 'scientific' description of the special posse member that
I pick out.  

In the back room of the taxidermy shop is a secret retracting stairway covered by a
throw rug. This leads to the special cellar room where Zeke keeps his trophy collection, the one
that other people just wouldn't understand. When the posse come down to investigate, Zeke is
down there working on his latest kill, Lily the saloon gal. She is spread out on a table in the
center of the room. With a successful Notice check, the hero opening the stairwell catches a
glimpse of lantern light extinguished just as he lowers the stairs. Zeke hides when the heroes
come down.

> Several lanterns hang from the web-covered floor joists. You notice right away that the wick in
one of them is glowing a faint red. You see what appear to be human figures standing on little
platforms line along the south and west walls. There are seven of them, but platforms for ten.
Most of these figures are covered with a white sheet, but two of them are just standing there
exposed. One is an Indian while the other looks like a banker or some Eastern dude in fancy
duds. They are both frozen stiff. A pretty but dead woman lies on a table in the center of the
room.

Each figure is marked with a place card reading, “North American Caucasian Male” or “Female homo sapien sapien – Cheyenne Tribe”.

Zeke is hiding on the south side on the last platform underneath a white sheet. He snatched up the tortoise shell rattle because he doesn't want anyone to take it. Someday he is going to figure out what the thing does. He also has a carving knife. He tries to hold as still as possible. If the posse pull off the sheet, he darts for the stairs. When Zeke is discovered, he accidentally drops the rattle and the shells bursts, releasing the nearly one hundred Manitous that the Pawnee shamans have captured in it over the years. These Manitous possess the human trophies and attack the posse.

The round following the Zeke's discovery, the human trophies animate and come down
off of their stands wielding canes, tomahawks, or whatever they happen to be holding in the
display. Everyone witnessing this must make a Guts check. Zeke's primary goal is to escape up
the stairs and uses his knife on anyone that gets in his way.

### Ending (help)

If Zeke manages to escape or if the posse flees the room and goes back into the taxidermy office, they find that the Manitou have also possessed the stuffed animals here. The sight of the animals writhing to get free from stands or the wall is enough to frighten anyone. The posse must make another Guts roll.

Running out of the building, they will be met by the shaman, Spring Star, guarded by his two sons. Spring Star is in the middle of a ceremony and is singing and shaking a similar rattle. His sons urge the posse to get away from the house. They can stick around if they like, but there isn’t much that they can do. After a long ceremony, Spring Star will recapture all of the Manitou and leave. When he is done, Spring Star will attempt to find out what happened to Zeke through crude English. If Zeke manages to escape completely from the building, the Pawnee catch him, kill him, and take his scalp.
